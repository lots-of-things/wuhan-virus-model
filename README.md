This model analyzes how the rate of travel between two cities could affect whether an epidemic in one leads to an outbreak in the other.  It's a very simple nonlinear model that tries to get a first order approximation of how long before stopping transportation is too late.

I wrote the model to help understand how to develop [this interactive simulation](http://bl.ocks.org/stedn/b0acdeba81751c5f8e4ccaa74ccb09a9) of the spread from Wuhan to SF.  I'll update with a post on the reasoning the model and the math behind the non-dimensionalization soon.
