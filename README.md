This model analyzes how the rate of travel between two cities could affect whether an epidemic in one leads to an outbreak in the other.  It's a very simple nonlinear model that tries to get a first order approximation of how long before stopping transportation is too late.

I'll update with a post on the reasoning the model and the math behind the non-dimensionalization soon.
