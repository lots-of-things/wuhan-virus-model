This model analyzes how the rate of travel between two cities could affect whether an epidemic in one leads to an outbreak in the other.  It's a very simple nonlinear model that tries to get a first order approximation of how long before stopping transportation is too late.

I wrote the model to help understand how to develop [this interactive simulation](http://bl.ocks.org/stedn/b0acdeba81751c5f8e4ccaa74ccb09a9) of the spread from Wuhan to SF.

[This pdf](https://github.com/lots-of-things/wuhan-virus-model/blob/master/Wuhan_to_SF_infection_model.pdf) contains a derivation of the model non-dimensionalization and an approximation of the critical time after which the infection will spread in the second city.
